# Overview 
This demo showcases how to utilize the Zilliqa official [multisig contract](https://github.com/Zilliqa/zilliqa-developer/blob/main/products/multisig/src/smartcontract/multisig_wallet_with_zrc2.scilla.js) to transfer Zilliqa's native tokens, ZIL. In particular, the transfer must be signed by two parties. And the contract is written in Zilliqa-native language, [Scilla](https://scilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scilla-in-depth.html). The demo is written in Javascript using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) framework. It runs on the Zilliqa official [testnet](https://dev-api.zilliqa.com).

If the above accounts do not have enough balances, run the (faucet)[https://dev-wallet.zilliqa.com/faucet?network=testnet] to receive amounts. 

# Deploy Multisig Contract
The admins of the contract are Addr0 and Addr1, i.e., a transfer from this contract must be signed by both Addr0 and Addr1.
